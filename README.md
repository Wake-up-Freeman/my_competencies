## Why of Wake up Freeman ?

"Growing up under a communist regime has left a lasting imprint on my life and personality, instilling in me a deep appreciation for freedom and individual rights. My experiences have made me acutely aware of the subtle yet significant ways in which societies can shift towards the dystopian reality depicted in George Orwell's '1984'. This awareness has been a guiding force in my travels around the world while leading business transformation projects, constantly broadening my perspective. The classics of literature and philosophy have further enriched my understanding, offering insights into the human condition and the delicate balance of societal structures. Amidst these reflections, I discovered Bitcoin (BTC) and its transformative potential â€“ a beacon of decentralization and empowerment in an increasingly controlled world. ðŸ˜Š"
