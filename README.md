## Why of Wake up Freeman ?

"Growing up under a communist regime has left a lasting imprint on my life and personality, instilling in me a deep appreciation for freedom and individual rights. This awareness of societal shifts towards the dystopian reality depicted in George Orwell's '1984' has been a constant companion in my journey. It's why the mission of 'Wake up Freeman,' a blockchain validator organization, resonates so deeply with me. As a part of this movement, I contribute to the pillars of decentralization and freedom, standing against the tide of control and surveillance.

Traveling the world while leading business transformation projects, I've seen firsthand the diverse ways societies operate and the importance of maintaining individual liberties. My explorations in the classics of literature and philosophy have further enriched my understanding, offering timeless insights into the human condition and the fragile balance of power.

Amidst these reflections and endeavors, I discovered Bitcoin (BTC) and its transformative potential. Bitcoin, much like 'Wake up Freeman,' symbolizes a beacon of decentralization and empowerment in an increasingly controlled world. It's a testament to the power of collective action in preserving the freedoms we love. ðŸ˜Š"
